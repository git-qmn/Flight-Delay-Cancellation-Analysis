# Uncovering Patterns in U.S. Flight Data: An Analysis of Delays, Cancellations, and Travel Trends

## Overview
This project investigates flight delays and cancellations in the U.S. by analyzing airline performance, seasonal trends, and travel disruptions. The study aims to provide insights into the causes and patterns of flight disruptions using data-driven approaches.

## Course Information
- **Course**: BA843 - Big Data Analytics, Master of Science in Business Analytics, Boston University
- **Team Members**: Quan Nguyen, Jialin Liu, Varun Kaza

## Dataset
The project utilizes historical U.S. flight data, which includes key variables such as departure and arrival times, airline carriers, delay causes, and cancellation reasons.
